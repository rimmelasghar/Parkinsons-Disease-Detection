# Parkinsons-Disease-Detection 
Parkinson’s disease is a progressive disorder of the central nervous system affecting movement and inducing tremors and stiffness. It has 5 stages to it and affects more than 1 million individuals every year in India. This is chronic and has no cure yet. It is a neurodegenerative disorder affecting dopamine-producing neurons in the brain.
In this Python Machine learning project, I have build a model using python which can accurately detect the presence of Parkinson’s disease in one’s body.

# Detecting Parkinson’s Disease with XGBoost
In this Project I have used scikit-learn, numpy, pandas, and xgboost, I have build a model using an XGBClassifier and loaded the data, get the features and labels, scale the features, then split the dataset, build an XGBClassifier, and then calculate the accuracy of the model.
before diving into it lets see what is XGBoost

## What is XGBoost?
XGBoost is a new Machine Learning algorithm designed with speed and performance in mind. XGBoost stands for eXtreme Gradient Boosting and is based on decision trees. In this project, we will import the XGBClassifier from the xgboost library; this is an implementation of the scikit-learn API for XGBoost classification.

# Prerequisites
You’ll need to install the following libraries with pip:
-> NUMPY
-> PANDAS
-> SKLEARN
-> XGBOOST

You can easily download this libaries using pip by using following command:

pip install numpy pandas sklearn xgboost

# Summary 
In this Python project,I have made a model to detect the presence of Parkinson’s Disease in individuals using various factors. I have used an XGBClassifier for this and made use of the sklearn library to prepare the dataset. This gives an accuracy of 94.87%, which is great considering the number of lines of code in this python project.

Dont Forget to follow me so we can be a part of this awesome journey of ML projects.
